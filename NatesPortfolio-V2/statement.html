      Artist Statement
    </h2>
	<p>
	  The body of work Iâ€™ve chosen highlights the best examples of my style 
	  and abilities throughout the last three years of high school 
	  practicing ceramics. My work ranges from functional vessels to 
	  hand-built sculptures. My forms are both inorganic and organic, 
	  taking inspiration from nature, the human form and architecture. I 
	  usually start the process with sketches and a plan, but I allow for 
	  change during each stage of making. The sculptural pieces tend to 
	  evolve the most from start to finish, and as a whole each work 
	  inspires the next. My art is intended to ask questions, questions I 
	  usually ask myself but are often universal. Not every piece is 
	  profound though most are about practice and pushing my skills. My 
	  goal for continued practice in ceramics is to further improve my 
	  skill set and explore new ideas.
